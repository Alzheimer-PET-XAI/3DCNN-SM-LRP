# Data 
The FDG PET scans employed were obtained from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), http://adni.loni.usc.edu/. 

The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD).
